# Frame-Locker

Frame Locker is a blender addon with the simple purpose of locking Blender to a single frame, whether to stop from auto keyframing the wrong frame, or just simply to be able to play and pause music without Blender playing an animation to a random frame, Frame Locker seeks to stop this.

Frame Locker is located in the sidebar of the dope sheet, accessed by pressing N by default. On the right of the dope sheet, a panel will open showing the Frame Locker toggle. Once toggled on Blender will stick to the current frame until toggled off.

Frame Locker works by canceling a frame change whenever it beings, and thus you can see a brief moment where the animation tries to play until Frame Locker stops it. If there are any issues, please create an issue on Github, as this is my first Blender addon!
